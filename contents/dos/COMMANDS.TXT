ADOS-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starts AccessDOS, a package of MS-DOS extensions for persons with motion 
and hearing disabilities.

See ADOS.TXT for information about using AccessDOS.

SYNTAX
------
ADOS [/A] [/C] [/L] [/M] [/X]

SWITCHES
--------
/A
   Installs AccessDOS.

/C
   Runs AcessDOS in color mode.

/L
   Runs AccessDOS in LCD mode.

/M
   Runs AccessDOS in monochrome mode.

/X
   Runs AccessDOS in minimal mode.

ASSIGN-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Redirects requests for disk operations on one drive to a different drive. 

Some older programs can read and write files only on drives A and B. With 
the ASSIGN command, you can redirect disk operations for those programs so 
that you can read and write files on drives other than A and B. 

SYNTAX 
------
ASSIGN [x[:]=y[:][...]] 

To redirect all drive letters to their original drives, use the following 
syntax: 

ASSIGN 

To display a list of the current assignments, use the following syntax: 

ASSIGN /STATUS 

PARAMETERS 
----------
x  
   Specifies the drive from which you want to redirect read and write 
   operations. This value must be a letter. The use of the colon (:) 
   is optional. y Specifies the existing drive to which you want to redirect 
   read and write operations. This value must be a letter. The use of the 
   colon (:) is optional. 
  
SWITCH
------
/STATUS  
   Lists current assignments. You can abbreviate this switch as 
   /STA or /S. 
	 
NOTES
-----

Invalid uses of ASSIGN 
----------------------
You must not assign the drive letter of your hard disk to another drive. 
You should not use ASSIGN for a drive that is in use by a program. 

You cannot use the drive letter of a hard disk drive that does not 
exist for either the x or the y parameter. 

Avoid the use of ASSIGN in the following cases: 
o With commands requiring drive information (BACKUP, JOIN, LABEL, RESTORE, 
  SUBST) 

o With the DISKCOPY and FORMAT commands, which ignore drive reassignments 

o During typical use of MS-DOS, unless a program cannot read and write files 
  on the specified drive 

Using ASSIGN with the APPEND command 
------------------------------------
If you use both the ASSIGN and APPEND commands, you must use APPEND first, 
even if the commands affect different drives. 

Using ASSIGN for network drives 
-------------------------------
You can use the ASSIGN command for network drives. 

Canceling a previous assignment as the result of a new assignment 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Assigning a drive letter to a drive cancels previous assignments to it. 
Suppose you assign drive A to drive letter C, as the following example 
shows: 

ASSIGN A=C

Later you assign drive B to drive letter C, as the following example shows: 

ASSIGN B=C

As a result, drive A is no longer assigned to drive letter C. 

Using the SUBST command instead of ASSIGN 
-----------------------------------------
You should use the SUBST command instead of ASSIGN. The following commands 
are equivalent: 

ASSIGN A=C
SUBST A: C:\

EXAMPLES
--------
Suppose you want to use drive C to read and write files, but your program 
requires you to put your program disk into drive A and your data disk into 
drive B. To reassign the drive letters A and B to drive C, type the 
following command: 

ASSIGN A=C B=C

This command causes MS-DOS to look for your program and data files on 
drive C. 

To reset all drive letters to their original drives, type the ASSIGN 
command without parameters, as follows: 

ASSIGN

BACKUP---------------------------------------------------------------------

Backs up one or more files from one disk onto another. 

You can back up files onto either a hard disk or floppy disk(s). 
Files can also be backed up from one floppy disk onto another, even 
if the disks have different numbers of sides or sectors. MS-DOS displays 
the name of each file it backs up. 

SYNTAX 
------
BACKUP source destination-drive: [/S] [/M] [/A][/F[:size]] 
   [/D:date [/T:time]][/L[:[drive:][path]logfile]] 

PARAMETERS
----------
source  
   Specifies the location of files you want to back up. 
   Source can consist of a drive letter and colon, a directory name, 
   a filename, or a combination. 
	
destination-drive:  
   Specifies the drive that contains the disk on which you want to store 
   any backup files. The backup files are stored in the BACKUP.nnn and 
   CONTROL.nnn files. That is, BACKUP assigns the names BACKUP.001 
   and CONTROL.001 to the files it creates on the first backup disk you 
   use, BACKUP.002 and CONTROL.002 to the files it creates on the second 
   backup disk, and so on. 
   
SWITCHES
/S 
   Backs up the contents of all subdirectories. 
   
/M 
   Backs up only files that have changed since the last backup, 
   and turns off the archive attribute of the original files. 
   
/A 
   Adds backup files to an existing backup disk without deleting 
   existing files. (The /A switch is ignored if the existing backup 
   disk contains backup files that were created by using the BACKUP 
   command from MS-DOS version 3.2 or earlier.) 
   
/F[:size] 
   Formats the backup disk to the size you specify. (The FORMAT command 
   must be present in the current path.) With this switch, you direct 
   BACKUP to format floppy disks that do not match the default size of 
   the drive. The BACKUP command formats an unformatted destination disk 
   even if you do not specify the /F switch. When BACKUP finishes 
   formatting, it begins backing up files onto the last disk it formatted. 
   Size specifies the size in kilobytes of the disk to be formatted. If 
   you do not specify size, the /F switch uses the default size of the 
   drive. The following list shows the valid values for size and a brief 
   description of each size: 
   
   160 or 160k or 160kb 
      160K, single-sided, double-density, 5.25-inch disk 
   180 or 180k or 180kb 
      180K, single-sided, double-density, 5.25-inch disk 
   320 or 320k or 320kb 
      320K, double-sided, double-density, 5.25-inch disk 
   360 or 360k or 360kb 
      360K, double-sided, double-density, 5.25-inch disk 
   720 or 720k or 720kb 
      720K, double-sided, double-density, 3.5-inch disk 
   1200 or 1200k or 1200kb or 1.2 or 1.2m or 1.2mb 
      1.2-MB, double-sided, quadruple-density, 5.25-inch disk 
   1440 or 1440k or 1440kb or 1.44 or 1.44m or 1.44mb 
      1.44-MB, double-sided, quadruple-density, 3.5-inch disk 
   2880 or 2880k or 2880kb or 2.88 or 2.88m or 2.88mb 
      2.88-MB, double-sided, 3.5-inch disk 

/D:date 
   Backs up only files modified on or after the specified date. The 
   date format depends on the setting you are using for the COUNTRY 
   command. 
/T:time Backs up only files modified at or after the specified time. 
   The time format depends on the setting you are using for the COUNTRY 
   command. 
/L[:[drive:][path]logfile] 
   Creates a log file and adds an entry to that file to record the 
   backup operation. If you do not specify a location for the log file, 
   BACKUP puts the file in the root directory of the source drive. If 
   you do not specify logfile, BACKUP names the file BACKUP.LOG. You 
   should not specify a removable drive (such as a floppy disk drive) 
   for this parameter; but once the backup is complete, you can copy the 
   log file to a floppy disk. 

NOTES
-----

Backing up onto a disk with files
---------------------------------
Unless you use the /A switch, BACKUP deletes old files (including 
read-only files) from a backup disk before adding new files to it. 

Backup log file 
---------------
If you use the /L switch and do not specify a name and location for 
the log file, the BACKUP command adds a file named BACKUP.LOG to the 
root directory of the source drive. If the BACKUP.LOG file already 
exists, BACKUP adds the current entry to the file. A backup log-file 
entry uses the following format: 

o The date and time of the backup appear on the first line. 
o Each filename appears on a separate line with the number of 
  the backup disk that contains the file. 

The backup log file can assist you later, when you need to identify 
the files you want to restore. The RESTORE command always returns a 
file to the original directory or subdirectory recorded in the backup 
log, creating the subdirectory if necessary. 

Labeling backup disks 
---------------------
It is important to label and number backup disks consecutively. As each 
disk is filled, BACKUP prompts you for the next disk. When you restore 
files, you need to insert the backup disks into the disk drive in the 
same sequence. To check the sequence of backup disks (MS-DOS version 3.3 
or later), use the DIR command to check the disk number. 

BACKUP and system files 
-----------------------
The BACKUP command cannot back up the system files IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS, 
and COMMAND.COM. You can use the SYS command to copy these files onto 
a floppy disk. 

Using an old version of the RESTORE command 
-------------------------------------------
You cannot use an old version of the RESTORE command (MS-DOS version 
3.2 or earlier) for files backed up with MS-DOS version 3.3 or later. 
If you attempt this, MS-DOS displays the following message: 
   
   Source does not contain backup files 
   
This error occurs because the format of old backup files differs from 
the format of files backed up with MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later. 

Using BACKUP with networks or redirected drives or directories 
--------------------------------------------------------------
If you are sharing files on a network, you can back up only those 
files to which you have access. You should not use BACKUP with a drive 
that has been redirected with the ASSIGN, JOIN, or SUBST command. If you 
do, the RESTORE command may not be able to restore the files. 

Backup exit codes 
-----------------
The following list shows each exit code and a brief description of its 
meaning: 

0    The backup was successful.

1    No files were found to back up.

2    Some files were not backed up because of file-sharing conflicts.

3    The user pressed CTRL+C to stop the process.

4    The process stopped because of an error.

You can use the ERRORLEVEL parameter on the IF command line in a 
batch program to process exit codes returned by the BACKUP command. 
 
EXAMPLES
--------
Suppose you want to back up all the files in the \PUBLIC\SMITH directory 
on drive C onto a blank, formatted disk in drive A. To do so, type the 
following: 

BACKUP C:\PUBLIC\SMITH\*.* A:
 
Suppose you need to back up all files in the \PUBLIC\SMITH directory 
on drive C onto a 720K floppy disk in drive B. If the floppy disk is 
unformatted, BACKUP formats it before backing up any files. Because the 
/S switch is not specified in the following command, files in 
subdirectories are not backed up: 

BACKUP C:\PUBLIC\SMITH\*.* B: /F:720K

To write a simple batch program named SMITH that supports the BACKUP 
command's exit codes and the /S switch, you can type the following 
commands by using MS-DOS Editor: 

echo off
rem Smith's backup command
backup c:\public\smith\*.* b: /s
if errorlevel 4 goto error
if errorlevel 3 goto abort
if errorlevel 2 goto conflict
if errorlevel 1 goto no_files
if errorlevel 0 goto success
:error
echo Backup stopped the process due to an error
goto exit
:abort
echo You just pressed CTRL+C to stop the backup
goto exit
:conflict
echo One or more files were not backed up due to a sharing conflict
goto exit
:no_files
echo Sorry, but there were no files to back up
goto exit
:success
echo The backup was successful
goto exit
:exit

CHOICE----------------------------------------------------------------------

A command used by the Setup program. The CHOICE.COM file is the same one
included with MS-DOS 6.22.

COMP------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compares the contents of two files or sets of files byte by byte. 

COMP can compare files on the same drive or on different drives, in 
the same directory or in different directories. As COMP compares the 
files, it displays their locations and filenames.
 
SYNTAX 
------
COMP [data1] [data2] [/D] [/A] [/L] [/N=number] [/C]

PARAMETERS
---------- 
data1 
   Specifies the location and name of the first file or set of files 
   you want to compare. You can use wildcards (* and ?) to specify 
   multiple files. 

data2 
   Specifies the location and name of the second file or set of files 
   you want to compare. You can use wildcards (* and ?) to specify 
   multiple files. 

SWITCHES
--------
/D 
   Displays differences in decimal format. (The default format is 
   hexadecimal.) 

/A 
   Displays differences as characters. 

/L 
   Displays the number of the line on which a difference occurs, 
   instead of displaying the byte offset. 

/N=number 
   Compares the first number of lines of both files, even if the 
   files are different sizes. 

/C 
   Performs a comparison that is not case-sensitive. 

NOTES
-----

Comparing files with the same names
-----------------------------------
The files you want to compare can have the same filename, provided 
they are in different directories or on different drives. If you do 
not specify a filename for data2, the default filename for data2 is 
the same as the filename in data1. You can use wildcards (* and ?) 
to specify filenames. 

Special cases for data1 and data2 
---------------------------------
If you omit necessary components of either data1 or data2 or if you 
omit data2, COMP prompts you for the missing information. If data1 
contains only a drive letter or a directory name with no filename, 
the default filename for data1 is *.*. Therefore, COMP compares all 
the files in the specified directory to the file specified in data2. 
If data2 contains only a drive letter or a directory name, the 
default filename for data2 is the same as that in data1. 

How the COMP command identifies mismatching information 
-------------------------------------------------------
During the comparison, COMP displays messages to identify the 
locations of unequal information in the two files. Each message 
indicates the offset memory address of the unequal bytes and the 
contents of the bytes themselves (in hexadecimal notation unless 
you specify the /A or /D switch). The message has the following 
format: 

   Compare error at OFFSET xxxxxxxx
   file1 = xx
   file2 = xx

After 10 unequal comparisons, COMP stops comparing the files and 
displays the following message: 

   10 Mismatches – ending compare 

Comparing files of different sizes 
----------------------------------
You cannot compare files of different sizes unless you specify the 
/N switch. If the file sizes are different, COMP displays the 
following message: 

   Files are different sizes
   Compare more files (Y/N)?

Press Y to compare another pair of files. Press N to stop the COMP 
command. 

If you press Y in response to the prompt, COMP includes any switches 
you specified on the command line in every comparison it makes, 
until you press N or retype the command. 

When comparing files of different sizes, use the /N switch to 
compare only the first portion of each file. 

Comparing files sequentially 
----------------------------
If you use wildcards to specify multiple files, COMP finds the first 
file matching data1 and compares it with the corresponding file in 
data2, if it exists. COMP reports the results of the comparison, 
then does the same for each file matching data1. When finished, 
COMP displays the following message: 

   Compare more files (Y/N)? 

To compare more files, press Y. COMP prompts you for the locations 
and names of the new files. To stop the comparisons, press N. When 
you press Y, COMP prompts you for switches to use. If you don't 
specify any switches, COMP uses the ones you specified before. 

If COMP cannot find the files 
-----------------------------
If COMP cannot find the file(s) you specify, it prompts you with a 
message to determine whether you want to compare more files. 

CV--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starts CodeView versions 3.0 through 3.13.

CAUTION: Using versions 3.0 to 3.13 of the CodeView CV.EXE
file may cause data loss if your system has a 80386 memory
manager (such as EMM386.EXE) and device drivers or programs
that use extended memory. To determine which version you
have, type CV.EXE at the command prompt.

To start CodeView versions 3.0 to 3.13 safely, use the
CV.COM file included with the Supplemental disk, and HIMEM.SYS 
version 2.77 or later.

To use the CV.COM file included with the Supplemental disks, copy it
to the directory that contains your CV.EXE file.

This problem has been fixed in CodeView version 3.14. Call
Microsoft C Support to get this version.

DRVBOOT---------------------------------------------------------------------

Creates a bootable DriveSpace floppy disk. 

SYNTAX
------
DRVBOOT [drive:]

PARAMETER
---------
[drive:]
   Specifies the floppy disk drive for the DriveSpace floppy disk.

NOTES
-----
You can use the floppy disk to start any system with MS-DOS 6.22.
Because the disk is compressed, you can include many more
files on the disk than on most uncompressed disks.

Before you can use DRVBOOT, you must install DriveSpace on your
hard disk. DRVBOOT only works with high-density (1.44 or 1.2 MB) 
floppy disks.

DVORAK.SYS------------------------------------------------------------------

Provides alternative keyboard layouts for people who have difficulty
using the standard QWERTY layout.

The commands for installing the layouts in your CONFIG.SYS file are as 
follows. (If DOS is not the directory that contains your MS-DOS files, 
substitute the correct directory name in the commands below.)

Two-handed layout
-----------------
keyb dv,,c:\dos\dvorak.sys

Left-handed layout
------------------
keyb lh,,c:\dos\dvorak.sys

Right-handed layout
-------------------
keyb rh,,c:\dos\dvorak.sys

EDLIN-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Starts Edlin, a line-oriented text editor with which you can create 
and change ASCII files. 

Edlin numbers each line of the text file that is located in memory. 
You can use Edlin to insert, modify, copy, move, and delete lines 
of the file. If you want to use a full-screen editor, use the EDIT 
command. 

SYNTAX
------
EDLIN [drive:][path] filename [/B] 

PARAMETER
---------
[drive:][path] filename 
   Specifies the location and name of an ASCII file on a disk. If 
   the file exists, Edlin opens it. If the file does not exist, 
   Edlin creates a file in memory and uses the specified location 
   and filename to create the file on a disk when you use the Edlin 
   E command. 

SWITCH
------
/B 
   Specifies that Edlin is to ignore the end-of-file character 
   (CTRL+Z). 

NOTES
-----

Maximum line length 
-------------------
Edlin accepts a maximum of 253 characters per line. 

Edlin commands 
--------------
The following is a list of Edlin commands with a brief description 
of each command: 

[line] 
   Displays the line you specify. 

? 
   Displays a list of Edlin commands. 

A 
   Loads a portion of a file into memory when insufficient memory 
   prohibits loading the entire file. 

C 
   Copies a block of consecutive lines to the line number you 
   specify. 

D 
   Deletes a block of consecutive lines. 

E 
   Writes the edited file from memory to a disk (saves the file), 
   and stops the Edlin session. 

I 
   Inserts one or more lines. 

L 
   Displays a block of consecutive lines. 

M 
   Moves a block of consecutive lines. 

P 
   Displays a file one page at a time. 

Q 
   Stops the Edlin session without writing the edited file from 
   memory to a disk. 

R 
   Searches for a string of one or more characters, and replaces 
   it. 

S 
   Searches for a string of one or more characters. 

T 
   Merges the contents of another file on a disk with the contents 
   of the file that is in memory. 

W 
   Writes the first portion of the file in memory to a disk. 

Meaning of the asterisk character in Edlin 
------------------------------------------
The asterisk (*) is used for two purposes in Edlin. When an 
asterisk appears as the only character on the display line, it is 
the Edlin prompt after which you type Edlin commands. When an 
asterisk appears after a line number on the display line, it 
indicates that the line is the current line (where the cursor is 
located). 

Meaning of a page of text 
-------------------------
A page of text is one full screen of information. With a 25-line 
screen mode, Edlin displays 24 lines of text per page. The number 
of lines per page depends on the screen mode you are using. 

Starting and stopping insert mode 
---------------------------------
To insert lines into the file in memory, use the Edlin I (insert) 
command. Once you have finished inserting lines, press ENTER and 
then CTRL+C to stop insert mode. For more information about 
inserting lines, see the Edlin I command. 

Editing keys 
------------
MS-DOS provides several editing keys that you can use to edit the 
file in memory. 

EDLIN:[line]----------------------------------------------------------------

Displays the line of text you specify. 

When you type a line number as a command, Edlin displays two lines. 
The first line contains the number you specified and its associated 
text. The second line contains the number again, followed by the 
cursor. The text on the first line of the display serves as a 
template for the second line. On the second line of the display, you 
can press ENTER to cancel the command without changing the text, 
type replacement text, or edit the line of text. 

SYNTAX
------ 
[line] 

PARAMETERS
----------
line 
   Specifies the number of the line you want Edlin to display. To 
   see the number and text of the current line, press ENTER. 

NOTE
----

Entering changes into memory 
----------------------------
After you edit a line, press ENTER to enter the changes into 
memory. 

Caution
If you press ENTER while the cursor is in the middle of a line, 
Edlin deletes the portion of the line that is between the cursor 
and the end of the line. 

For information about saving the edited file from memory to a disk, 
see the Edlin E and Edlin W commands. 

EXAMPLE
-------
Suppose that the following file is in memory and ready to edit. 
When you use the Edlin L (list) command at the Edlin prompt, Edlin 
displays the contents of the file. 

   1: Dear Mr. Muster:
   2:
   3: Congratulations on your promotion
   4: to the position of Senior Chemical
   5: Engineer. I continue to be most
   6: impressed with your work.

To edit line 6, type 6. Edlin displays the following two lines: 

   6:*impressed with your work.
   6:*_

The first line contains the specified line number and its associated 
text. The second line contains the same line number and the cursor. 

Now suppose you want to insert the word "fine" before the word 
"work" in the previous example. You can specify that Edlin is to 
redisplay a portion of the first line, beginning at the cursor 
position on the second line. First, press F2 and type W. Edlin 
displays up to, but not including, the first “w” in line 6, as 
follows: 

   6:*impressed _

Then, press F2 and type W again. Edlin displays up to, but not 
including the next "w" in line 6, as follows: 

   6:*impressed with your _

Now press the INSERT key and type FINE and then a space. Then press 
the F3 key. Edlin displays the edited line, as follows: 

   6:*impressed with your fine work._

Press ENTER to accept the change. 

At the Edlin prompt, use the Edlin L (list) command to see a display 
of the edited file now in memory. Edlin displays the following: 

   1: Dear Mr. Muster:
   2:
   3: Congratulations on your promotion
   4: to the position of Senior Chemical
   5: Engineer. I continue to be most
   6:*impressed with your fine work.

EDLIN: A(APPEND)------------------------------------------------------------

Loads a portion of a file into memory when insufficient memory 
prevents Edlin from loading the entire file. 

When you start Edlin, it reads as many lines as possible from your 
disk file into memory. If the size of your file exceeds available 
memory, you must edit your file in stages. That is, you edit the 
first part of the file, write that part of the file to your disk by 
using the W (write) command, and then load more unedited lines from 
your disk into memory. 

SYNTAX
------
[n]A 

PARAMETERS
---------- 
n 
   Specifies the number of lines you want Edlin to read into 
   memory from the disk. 

NOTES
-----

Default setting 
---------------
If you do not specify a value for n, Edlin loads lines from the 
disk file until available memory is 75-percent full. If available 
memory is already 75-percent full, Edlin loads no lines. 

Freeing extra memory 
--------------------
If available memory is already full, you may be able to free memory 
by writing a portion of the file to a disk, by stopping other 
programs, or by restarting MS-DOS after quitting MS-DOS Editor. 
Restarting MS-DOS clears memory being used by memory-resident 
programs. 

End-of-file message 
-------------------
After the A command reads the last line of the file into memory, 
Edlin displays the following message: 

   End of input file 

EXAMPLE
-------
Suppose the last 100 lines of your disk file do not fit into 
memory. After you edit the first part of the file and write a 
portion of it back to a disk, you can type the following command to 
load the remaining 100 lines into memory: 

   100a 

EDLIN: C(COPY)------------------------------------------------------

Copies a block of consecutive lines to one or more locations within 
the file in memory. 

The C command copies the block of consecutive lines you specify to 
a line number you specify. This block can be copied as many times 
as necessary. 

SYNTAX
------
[line1],[line2],line3[,count]C 

PARAMETERS
----------
line1 
   Specifies the first line you want Edlin to copy. 

line2 
   Specifies the last line you want Edlin to copy. 

line3 Specifies the line before which Edlin is to insert the 
   specified block of lines. 

count 
   Specifies the number of times you want Edlin to copy the block 
   of lines. 

NOTES
-----

Default settings 
----------------
If you omit line1 or line2, Edlin copies only the current line. You 
must include the commas on the command line even if you omit one or 
both of these parameters. 

If you omit the count parameter, Edlin copies the lines one time. 

Line renumbering 
----------------
After Edlin copies lines, you can use the Edlin L (list) command at 
the Edlin prompt to see the correctly renumbered lines. 

Overlapping line numbers 
------------------------
The line you specify for theline3 parameter cannot be part of the 
block of lines to be copied. If you overlap line numbers in this 
way, Edlin cannot complete the copy operation and displays the 
following message: 

   Entry error 

For example, the following command results in an error message: 

   3,20,15c 

EXAMPLES
--------
If you type the following command, Edlin copies lines 1 through 5 
one time, beginning on line 6: 

   1,5,6c 

Lines 6 through 10 become identical to lines 1 through 5. 

To copy the current line to line 5, use the following command: 

   ,,5c 

EDLIN: D(DELETE)------------------------------------------------------------

Deletes the block of consecutive lines you specify. 

SYNTAX
------
[line1][,line2]D 

PARAMETERS
----------
line1 
   Specifies the first line you want Edlin to delete. 
line2 
   Specifies the last line you want Edlin to delete. 

NOTES
-----

Default parameter values 
------------------------
If you omit both parameters or only the line2 parameter, Edlin 
deletes the current line. However, if you omit only the line1 
parameter, Edlin deletes the block of text that includes the current 
line through the line whose number is specified for line2. In the 
latter case, you cannot specify a line number for line2 that 
precedes the current line number. In general, the number you 
specify for line2 cannot be smaller than the number you specify for 
line1. If you omit only the line1 parameter, you need to insert a 
comma as a placeholder preceding line2, as shown in the syntax 
line. 

Line renumbering 
----------------
After Edlin deletes lines, you can use the Edlin L (list) command 
at the Edlin prompt to see the correctly renumbered lines that 
remain. 

EXAMPLES
--------
If you want Edlin to delete line 7, type: 

   7d 

If you want Edlin to delete the block of text on lines 22 through 
32, type the following command: 

   22,32d 

Finally, suppose that the number of the current line is 7. To 
specify that Edlin is to delete the block of text that includes the 
current line through line 11, type the following command: 

   ,11d 

EDLIN: E(EDLIN)-------------------------------------------------------------

Writes the current file from memory to a disk and stops the Edlin 
session. 

The E command renames the original input file on the disk with the 
.BAK extension, writes the edited file from memory to the original 
input file on the disk, and then stops the Edlin session. However, 
if the file in memory is one that you created during this session 
rather than one that Edlin loaded from a disk, Edlin does not 
create a backup (.BAK) file on the disk. 

SYNTAX
------
E 

NOTES
-----

Default drive and directory 
---------------------------
Edlin writes the edited file from memory to the drive, directory, 
and filename on a disk that you specified when you started the 
current Edlin session. If you omitted a drive name at that time, 
Edlin writes to the current drive. If you omitted a directory name 
at that time, Edlin writes to the current directory. 

Checking for disk space 
-----------------------
Before using the E command, you should be sure your disk contains 
enough free space for the entire edited file that is in memory. If 
it does not, Edlin loses part or all of the file. 

Read-only .BAK file 
-------------------
Suppose you want Edlin to save an edited file from memory to a 
disk, but the .BAK version of the file is a read-only file. In this 
case, Edlin displays a message in the following format to inform 
you that Edlin cannot replace the .BAK file: 

   Access denied  - [drive:][path] filename.BAK 

Both the original and backup versions of your file on the disk 
remain unchanged. 

EDLIN: I(INSERT)------------------------------------------------------------

Inserts lines before the line number you specify in the edited file 
in memory. 

If you are creating a new file, you must type the I command before 
you can insert a new line. Edlin displays the next line number each 
time you press ENTER. Edlin remains in insert mode until you press 
CTRL+C. 

SYNTAX
------
[line]I 

PARAMETERS
----------
line 
   Specifies the line number before which you want Edlin to insert 
   lines. The default value of line is the number of the current 
   line. 

NOTES
-----

Line renumbering 
----------------
When you quit insert mode, the line immediately following the 
inserted lines becomes the current line. You can use the Edlin L 
(list) command at the Edlin prompt to see the correctly renumbered 
lines. 

Inserting control characters 
----------------------------
To insert a control character in text, type ^V followed by the 
ASCII symbol that represents the control character. For example, to 
insert an escape character (CTRL+[), type the following: 

   ^V[ 

To insert a character that produces a tone (CTRL+G), type the 
following: 

   ^VG 

Appending text 
--------------
If the value for line exceeds the number of lines in the file you 
are editing or if you specify a number sign (#) for line, Edlin 
appends the inserted line(s) to the end of the file. In either 
case, the last line you insert becomes the current line. If only a 
portion of the file is in memory, the line is appended at the end 
of the portion in memory. 

EXAMPLES
--------
Suppose you have used the Edlin L (list) command at the Edlin 
prompt to display the following text on your screen: 

    1: Dear Mr. Muster:
    2:
    3: Congratulations on your promotion
    4: to the position of Senior Chemical
    5: Engineer. I continue to be most
    6: impressed with your work.
    7:
    8: Sincerely,
    9:
   10: S.L. Martin, President

Suppose you want to add another paragraph to the letter. To insert 
text before line 8, type 8I. Edlin displays the following: 

   8:*_

Now type the following line at the cursor on line 8: 

   8:*I think you will enjoy working with

Press ENTER at the complete of each new line and continue by typing 
the following lines: 

    9:*Mr. Lang on the new project. Please
   10:*let me know if there is anything I
   11:*can do to assist you.

Edlin displays the following: 

   12:*_

Insert a blank line by pressing ENTER and complete the insertion by 
pressing CTRL+C on the next line. You can type 1L to see the 
following correctly renumbered lines: 

    1: Dear Mr. Muster:
    2:
    3: Congratulations on your promotion
    4: to the position of Senior Chemical
    5: Engineer. I continue to be most
    6: impressed with your work.
    7:
    8: I think you will enjoy working with
    9: Mr. Lang on the new project. Please

   12:
   13:*Sincerely,
   14:
   15: S.L. Martin, President

EDLIN: L(LIST)--------------------------------------------------------------

Displays the block of consecutive lines you specify. 

SYNTAX
------
[line1][,line2] l 

PARAMETERS
----------
line1 
   Specifies the first line you want Edlin to display. 

line2 
   Specifies the last line you want Edlin to display. 

NOTES
-----

Default values
--------------
You can omit the line1 parameter, the line2 parameter, or both. The 
following list describes the default value(s) for each of these 
cases: 

o If you omit only the line1 parameter, Edlin displays up to one 
  page (full screen of text) at a time, beginning 11 lines before 
  the current line and ending with the line whose number is 
  specified in line2. When you omit only line1, you must insert a 
  comma as a placeholder. 

o If you omit only the line2 parameter, Edlin displays up to one 
  page, beginning with the line whose number is specified in line1. 

o If you use the Edlin L (List) command with no parameters, Edlin 
  displays up to one page, beginning 11 lines before the current 
  line. If you install the ANSI.SYS device driver, the number of 
  lines Edlin displays per page depends on the type of monitor you 
  have. This number might be greater than 24. 

Blocks of more than one page
----------------------------
When the block of lines you specify contains more than one page, 
Edlin displays the first page and then prompts you with the 
following message: 

   Continue (Y/N)? 

EXAMPLE
-------
To see lines 5 through 10, type the following: 

   5,10l 

EDLIN: M(MOVE)---------------------------------------------------------------

Moves the block of consecutive lines you specify to another 
location in the file in memory. 

SYNTAX
------
[line1],[line2],line3M 

[line1],+n,line3M 

PARAMETERS
----------
line1 
   Specifies the first line you want Edlin to move. 

line2 
   Specifies the last line you want Edlin to move. 

line3 
   Specifies the line before which you want Edlin to move the block 
   of lines. 

+n 
   Specifies that you want Edlin to move the block of lines that 
   begins with the line whose number is specified in line1 and 
   includes the next n lines. If you omit the line1 parameter, the 
   block of lines to be moved begins with the current line. 

NOTES
-----

Line renumbering
----------------
After Edlin moves lines, you can use the Edlin L (list) command at 
the Edlin prompt to see the correctly renumbered lines. 

Overlapping line numbers 
------------------------
The line you specify for theline3 parameter cannot be part of the 
block of lines to be moved. If you overlap line numbers in this 
way, Edlin cannot complete the move operation and displays the 
following message: 

   Entry error 

For example, the following command results in an error message: 

   5,10,8m 

EXAMPLES
--------
Suppose that the following file is in memory and ready to edit. You 
can type 1L at the Edlin prompt to see the contents of the file.

The following command specifies that Edlin is to move the block of 
lines including the current line through the next 25 lines to 
immediately before line 100: 
   ,+25,100m 

EDLIN: P(PAGE)--------------------------------------------------------------

Displays all or part of a file, one page (full screen of text) at a 
time. 

The last line displayed per screen becomes the current line. 

SYNTAX
------
[line1][, line2]P 

PARAMETERS
----------
line1 
   Specifies the first line you want Edlin to display. 

line2 
   Specifies the last line you want Edlin to display. 

NOTES
-----

Omitting only the line1 parameter 
---------------------------------
When you omit the line1 parameter, Edlin displays a page of text 
that begins with the current line through line2. 

Omitting only the line2 parameter 
---------------------------------
When you omit the line2 parameter, Edlin displays a page of text 
that begins with the line whose number you specify for line1. 

Omitting both parameters 
------------------------
When you omit both parameters, Edlin displays a page of text that 
begins with the line after the current line. 

EXAMPLE
-------
To see lines 100 through 200, one page at a time, type the 
following command: 

   100,200p 

EDLIN: Q(QUIT)---------------------------------------------------------------

Stops the current Edlin session without writing the edited file 
from memory to a disk. 

When you use the Q command, the Edlin session stops and the MS-DOS 
prompt appears. 

To specify that Edlin is to write the edited file from memory to a 
disk before ending the current session, you must use the E (end) 
command. 

SYNTAX
------
Q 

NOTES
-----

A difference between the Q and E commands 
-----------------------------------------
Suppose that the file you are editing is one that Edlin loaded into 
memory from a disk at the beginning of this session rather than one 
that you created in memory during the session. If you use the Q 
command to quit the session, the contents of both the original input 
disk file and the .BAK version of the disk file (if one exists) 
remain unchanged. However, if you use the E command to quit the 
session and the file you are editing has changed during the 
session, the edits are saved and the original input disk file 
becomes the .BAK version. 

Quitting Edlin without writing the edited file from memory to a disk 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Use the following procedure to quit the Edlin session without 
writing the edited file from memory to a disk: 

1. At the Edlin prompt, type Q. Edlin displays the following 
   message: 

Abort edit (Y/N)? _ 

2. Press Y (for yes). 

EDLIN: R(REPLACE)-----------------------------------------------------------

Searches a block of consecutive lines for a string of one or more 
characters you specify, and replaces each occurrence of that string 
with another string you specify. 

The last line in which the replacement occurs becomes the new 
current line. 

SYNTAX
------
[line1][,line2][?]R[string1][separator string2] 

PARAMETERS
----------
line1 
   Specifies the first line in which you want Edlin to replace the 
   string specified in string1. 

line2 
   Specifies the last line in which you want Edlin to replace the 
   string specified in string1. 

? (question mark) 
   Specifies that Edlin is to prompt you by displaying a 
   confirmation message before replacing an occurrence of the 
   string specified in string1. 

string1 
   Specifies the string that you want Edlin to replace. 

separator 
   Separates the string1 and string2 values. The only valid value 
   for this parameter is the end-of-file character (CTRL+Z). 

string2 
   Specifies the new string that is to replace each occurrence of 
   the string specified for string1. 

NOTES
-----

Command-line spacing 
--------------------
You must not insert a space between the R and any subsequent 
parameter on the command line. 

Default settings 
----------------
If you omit the line1 parameter, Edlin begins the search on the line after 
the current line. If you omit the line2 parameter, Edlin stops the search 
at the end of the file or at the end of the portion of text in memory. 

If you omit the string1 parameter, Edlin uses the more recently used of 
the following two values: the value that you specified for string1 the 
last time you used the R command or the value that you specified for string 
the last time you used the S command during this session. If you omit 
string1 and you have not used the R or S command yet during the editing 
session, the command stops. 

If you omit the string2 parameter, Edlin uses the value you specified the 
last time you used the R command during this session. If you omit the 
string2 parameter and you have not used the R command yet during this 
session, Edlin deletes all occurrences of the string that is specified 
for string1. 

Using the separator parameter 
-----------------------------
You must separate the string1 and string2 values by using the CTRL+Z key 
combination. Even if you omit string1, you need to press CTRL+Z to mark 
the beginning of string2. When you press the CTRL+Z key combination, the 
characters displayed are not “CTRL+Z”. Instead, you see the following: 

   ^Z 

Using the question mark (?) 
---------------------------
If you include the ? parameter in your command, Edlin displays the line 
containing the first occurrence of the string specified for string1 and 
prompts you by displaying the following confirmation message: 

   O.K.? _ 

If you press Y (for yes) or press ENTER, Edlin replaces this occurrence 
of the value for string1 with the value for string2 and searches for the 
next occurrence. If you press N (for no), Edlin does not replace this 
occurrence of the value for string1 and searches for the next occurrence. 

If you do not use the question mark (?) 
---------------------------------------
If you do not use the ? parameter to confirm replacements as they are made, 
Edlin makes all the replacements at once and then displays each line that 
contains a replacement. If a line contains two or more replacements, Edlin 
displays the line once for each replacement. 

EXAMPLES
--------
Suppose you want Edlin to carry out only each confirmed replacement of 
the word “mine” with the word “ours” within the first 20 lines of the 
edited file in memory. Type the first part of the command as follows, but 
do not press ENTER: 

   1,20?rmine 
   
To complete the command, press CTRL+Z (which appears on the screen as ^Z), 
type the word  OURS, and press ENTER. The complete command appears on the 
screen as follows: 

   1,20?rmine^Zours 

Suppose that the following file is in memory and ready to edit. You can 
type 1L at the Edlin prompt to see the contents of the file. 

    1: Dear Mr. Muster:
    2:
    3: Congratulations on your promotion
    4: to the position of Senior Chemical
    5: Engineer. I continue to be most
    6: impressed with your hard work.
    7:
    8: I think you will enjoy working with
    9: Mr. Lang on the new project. Please
   10: let me know if there is anything I
   11: can do to assist you.
   12:
   13: Sincerely,
   14:
   15: S.L. Martin, President
   16: Rockdale Corporation
   17: "A World Leader in Technology"

Now suppose that in lines 5 through 10 you want Edlin to replace all 
occurrences of the word "I" with the words "yours truly". Type the first 
part of the command as follows, but do not press ENTER: 

   5,10rI 
   
To complete the command, press CTRL+Z (which appears on the screen as ^Z), 
type the words "yours truly", and press ENTER. The complete command appears 
on the screen as follows: 

   5,10rI^Zyours truly 
   
Because the ? parameter is omitted, Edlin replaces the three occurrences 
of "I" without prompting you by displaying the confirmation message. When 
Edlin finishes carrying out the command, it displays the following lines, 
which are changed as a result of the three replacements: 

    5: Engineer. yours truly continue to be most
    8: yours truly think you will enjoy working with
   10: let me know if there is anything yours truly

In the previous example, two unintended replacements occurred--in lines 5 
and 8. You can avoid such changes by adding the ? parameter to the command. 
The completed command should appear on screen as follows: 

   5,10?rI^Zyours truly 
   
Now, Edlin prompts you by displaying the confirmation message for each 
occurrence of the string specified in string1 and carries out only confirmed 
replacements, as the following example shows: 

       5: Engineer. yours truly continue to be most
   O.K.? n
       8: yours truly think you will enjoy working with
   O.K.? n
     10: let me know if there is anything yours truly
   O.K.? y

When the ? parameter is used, Edlin does not automatically display the 
lines that are changed as a result of the confirmed replacements. If you 
type the Edlin L (list) command at the Edlin prompt, Edlin displays the 
edited file that is in memory, as follows: 

    1: Dear Mr. Muster:
    2:
    3: Congratulations on your promotion
    4: to the position of Senior Chemical
    5: Engineer. I continue to be most
    6: impressed with your hard work.
    7:
    8: I think you will enjoy working with
    9: Mr. Lang on the new project. Please
   10: let me know if there is anything yours truly
   11: can do to assist you.

   17: "A World Leader in Technology"

EDLIN: S(SEARCH)-----------------------------------------------------------

Searches for the string of one or more characters that you specify. 

Edlin displays the first line that contains an occurrence of the string. 
The search then stops and that line becomes the current line. 

SYNTAX
------
[line1][,line2][?]S[string] 

PARAMETERS
----------
line1 
   Specifies the first line you want Edlin to search. 
   
line2 
   Specifies the last line you want Edlin to search. 
   
? (question mark) 
   Specifies that Edlin is to prompt you by displaying a confirmation 
   message when it finds the first occurrence of the value you specify 
   for string. 
   
string 
   Specifies the string for which you want Edlin to search. You must not 
   insert a space before this parameter on the command line, unless the 
   space is part of the search text. 
   
NOTES
-----

Default settings 
----------------
If you omit the line1 parameter, Edlin starts the search on the line after 
the current line. If you omit the line2 parameter, Edlin stops the search 
at the end of the file. 

If you omit the string parameter, Edlin uses the more recently used of the 
following two values: the value that you specified for string the last time 
you used the S command, or the value that you specified for string1 the 
last time you used the R (replace) command during this session. If you omit 
the string parameter and this is your first use of an S or R command during 
this session, the S command stops immediately. 

Using the ? (question mark) 
---------------------------
If you include the ? parameter in your command, Edlin displays the line 
containing the first occurrence of the characters specified for string 
and prompts you with the following confirmation message: 

   O.K.? _ 
   
If you press Y (for yes) or press ENTER, the line displayed before the 
message becomes the current line and the search stops. If you press N 
(for no), the search continues until another occurrence is found or until 
Edlin displays the following message indicating that all lines have been 
searched: 

   Not found 
   
EXAMPLES

   O.K.? _

Press Y to stop the search. 

EDLIN: T(TRANSFER)---------------------------------------------------------

Merges the contents of another file from a disk with the contents of the 
file that is in memory. 

SYNTAX
------ 
[line]T[drive:][path] filename 

PARAMETERS
---------- 
line 
   Specifies the line number before which you want Edlin to insert the file 
   it is transferring from a disk. The default value of this parameter is 
   the number of the current line. 
   
[drive:][path] filename 
   Specifies the location and name of the file you want Edlin to insert 
   before the line whose number is specified in the line parameter. The 
   default value for drive is the current drive; the default value for path 
   is the current directory. 
   
NOTE
----
After Edlin merges a file from a disk, you can use the Edlin L (list) 
command at the Edlin prompt to see the correctly renumbered lines. 

EXAMPLE
-------
To merge a file named TAXES.MEM to line 12 of the file you are editing, 
type the following command: 

   12t taxes.mem 

EDLIN: W(WRITE)--------------------------------------------------------------

Writes the first portion of the edited file from memory to a disk. 

When you start Edlin, it reads as many lines as possible from your disk 
file into memory. If the size of your file exceeds available memory, you 
must edit your file in stages. That is, you edit part of the file, write 
that part to your disk by using the W command, and then load the next part 
from disk by using the A command. 

SYNTAX
------ 
[n]W 

PARAMETERS
---------- 
n 
   Specifies the number of lines that you want Edlin to write to the disk, 
   beginning with the first line of the edited file in memory. 

NOTES
-----

How the W command works 
-----------------------
When you open a file, Edlin reads lines from disk until memory is more 
than 75-percent full. It reserves the other 25 percent for changes you 
might make to the text. If your entire file fits in memory, Edlin displays 
the following message: 

   End of input file 
   
If you see this message, you do not need to use the W and A commands. 

If Edlin does not display this message when you open a file, the size of 
the file exceeds available memory. Therefore, you must edit your file in 
stages by using the W and A commands to write and read parts of the file, 
respectively. 

The W command does not write to disk the changes you make unless it was 
actually necessary to use the W command. Therefore, if you use the W command 
even though the whole file fit into memory and then you use the Q command to 
quit Edlin, none of the changes you made to the file are saved. 

Line renumbering 
----------------
After Edlin writes the first portion of the edited file from memory to a 
disk, you can use the Edlin L (list) command at the Edlin prompt to see 
the correctly renumbered lines that remain, beginning with line number 1. 

Default setting 
---------------
If you omit the n parameter, Edlin writes lines from the edited file 
in memory to a disk until memory is 25-percent full. 

EXAMPLE
-------
Suppose the final 100 lines of your disk file do not fit into memory. After 
you edit the first part of the file, you can free enough space to load the 
remainder of your disk file into memory and continue editing by typing the 
following command: 

   125w 
   
EXE2BIN----------------------------------------------------------------------

Converts .EXE (executable) files to binary format. 

EXE2BIN is included with MS-DOS as a courtesy to software developers. It 
is not useful for general users. 

SYNTAX
------ 
EXE2BIN [drive1:][path1]input-file [[drive2:][path2]output-file] 

PARAMETERS
---------- 
[drive1:][path1]input-file 
   Specifies the location and name of the input file. 
   
[drive2:][path2]output-file 
   Specifies the location and name of the output file. 
   
NOTES
-----

Restrictions on using EXE2BIN 
-----------------------------
The following restrictions apply when you use the EXE2BIN command: 
o The input file must be in valid .EXE format produced by the linker 
  and must not be packed. 

o The resident, or actual, code and data portions of the file combined 
  must be less than 64K. 

o There must be no STACK segment. 

Default values for parameters 
-----------------------------
EXE2BIN takes specific actions, depending upon the values you use for the 
input-file and output-file parameters. 

o The default filename extension for the filename you specify for input-file 
  is .EXE. EXE2BIN converts the input .EXE file to an output file in .BIN 
  format (a memory image of the program) and uses the location and filename 
  you specify for [drive2:][path2]output-file to store that output file. 

o If you do not specify drive2 or path2, EXE2BIN writes the output file 
  to the current drive and directory. 

o If you do not specify an output filename, EXE2BIN uses the input 
  filename. 

o The default extension for the filename specified for the output-file 
  parameter is .BIN. 

Types of conversion available with EXE2BIN 
------------------------------------------
Two types of conversion are possible, depending upon whether the initial 
CS:IP (Code Segment:Instruction Pointer) is specified in the .EXE file. 
The following list presents the two types: 

o If the CS:IP is not specified in the .EXE file, EXE2BIN performs a 
  pure binary conversion. If segment fixups are necessary (that is, if 
  the program contains instructions requiring segment relocation), EXE2BIN 
  prompts you for the fixup value. This value is the absolute segment at 
  which the program is to be loaded. The resulting program is usable only 
  when loaded at the absolute memory address specified by your program. 
  The command interpreter cannot load the program. 
  

o If the CS:IP is specified as 0000:100H, the file runs as a .COM file 
  with the instruction pointer set at 100H by the assembler statement ORG. 
  Include the .COM extension in the output-file parameter. No segment fixups 
  are allowed, because .COM files must be segment-relocatable; that is, they 
  must assume the entry conditions explained in the Microsoft Macro Assembler 
  manuals. The command interpreter can then load and run the program in the 
  same way as it loads and runs the .COM programs supplied on your MS-DOS 
  disk. 
  
FAKEMOUS---------------------------------------------------------------------

An IBM PS/2 mouse utility used with AccessDOS. 

See ADOS.TXT for information about using FAKEMOUS.

GRAFTABL---------------------------------------------------------------------

Enables MS-DOS to display the extended characters of a specified code page 
in graphics mode. 

Most monitors can display extended characters (ASCII characters 128 
through 255) without the GRAFTABL command. Use this command only if your 
monitor does not properly display these characters in graphics mode. 

SYNTAX
------ 
GRAFTABL [xxx] 

GRAFTABL /STATUS 

PARAMETERS
---------- 
xxx 
   Specifies the code page for which you want MS-DOS to define the 
   appearance of extended characters in graphics mode. The following 
   list shows each valid code-page identification number and its country 
   or language: 
   
437    
   United States 

850    
   Multilingual (Latin I) 

852    
   Slavic (Latin II) 

860    
   Portuguese 

863    
   Canadian-French 

865    
   Nordic 
   
SWITCH
------
/STATUS 
   Identifies the code page selected for use by GRAFTABL. 

NOTES
-----

GRAFTABL does not change the active code page 
---------------------------------------------
GRAFTABL affects only the appearance of extended characters of the code 
page you specify. To change the code page you are using, use the MODE or 
CHCP command. 

GRAFTABL exit codes 
-------------------
The following list shows each exit code and a brief description of its 
meaning: 

0    
   Character set was loaded successfully; no previous code page was
   loaded.

1    
   Character set was already loaded and replaced by new table.

2    
   A file error occurred.

3    
   An incorrect parameter was specified; no action was taken.

4    
   An incorrect version of MS-DOS is in use; version 5.0 is required.

You can use the ERRORLEVEL parameter on the IF command line in a batch 
program to process exit codes returned by GRAFTABL. For an example of a 
batch program that processes exit codes, see the BACKUP command. 

Effect on memory 
----------------
The GRAFTABL command decreases the amount of available conventional memory 
by about 1K. 

EXAMPLE
-------
To load the graphics character set for code page 437 (United States) 
into memory, type the following command: 

   graftabl 
   
To load the graphics character set for code page 860 (Portuguese) into 
memory, type the following command: 

   graftabl 860 

ISO.CPI--------------------------------------------------------------------

Contains ISO-compliant versions of certain character sets (codepages).

ISO-compliant fonts are special monospace (nonproportional) display fonts 
that, on some displays, are more readable than standard display fonts. 
(ISO fonts work only in 25-line mode; they do not support 43- or 50-line 
mode.) The ISO fonts included with MS-DOS 6.22 comply with Part 3 of 
the ISO 9241 Specification.

The ISO.CPI file contains ISO-compliant versions of the following character 
sets (codepages):

	437  United States            
	737  Greek II                 
	850  Multilingual (Latin I)   
	852  Slavic/Eastern European (Latin II)        
	855  Cyrillic I               
	857  Turkish
	860  Portuguese
	861  Icelandic
	863  Canadian-French
	865  Nordic
	866  Russian (Cyrillic II)
	869  Greek I

To install ISO fonts, you add or edit commands in your AUTOEXEC.BAT and 
CONFIG.SYS files. If your system is already set up to load a character
set (code page) other than the standard United States character set, 
carry out Procedure 1. Otherwise, carry out Procedure 2.

Procedure 1 -- If your system is already set up to load a character set 
other than the standard United States character set:

1. In your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, change the MODE CON CODEPAGE PREPARE
   command so that it specifies ISO.CPI instead of your usual 
   codepage (.CPI) file. 
   
   For example, suppose your current MODE command loads the Portugese 
   character set (860) and looks like the following:
       
       MODE CON CODEPAGE PREPARE=((860) C:\DOS\EGA.CPI)

   To use the ISO-compliant version of the Portugese character set, you 
   would change this command to specify ISO.CPI, as follows:

       MODE CON CODEPAGE PREPARE=((860) C:\DOS\ISO.CPI)

Procedure 2 -- If you are using the standard US character set:

1. Add a DEVICE command for DISPLAY.SYS to your CONFIG.SYS file. For
   example, if you want to use the United States hardware character 
   set (437), and if DISPLAY.SYS is in the C:\DOS directory, you would
   add the following command to your CONFIG.SYS file:
 
       DEVICE=C:\DOS\DISPLAY.SYS CON=(EGA,437,2)
 
   Note that DISPLAY.SYS uses about 12K of memory.

2. Add MODE commands to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to load and select the
   proper character sets (code pages). For example, to use the ISO
   version of the United States character set (437), you would add 
   the following commands to your AUTOEXEC.BAT files:
 
       MODE CON CODEPAGE PREPARE=((437) C:\DOS\ISO.CPI)
       MODE CON CODEPAGE SELECT=437


JOIN-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Joins a disk drive to a directory on another disk drive. 

When you use the JOIN command, MS-DOS treats the directories and files 
on a disk drive as the contents of the other drive and path you specify. 

SYNTAX
------
JOIN [drive1: [drive2:]path] 

JOIN drive: /D 

PARAMETERS
----------
drive1: 
   Specifies the floppy disk drive or logical drive that you want to join 
   to a different drive and directory. 
   
drive2: 
   Specifies the floppy disk drive or logical drive to which you want to 
   join drive1. 
   
path 
   Specifies the directory to which you want to join drive1. This directory 
   must be empty before you join drive1 to it. It must also be a directory 
   other than the root directory. 
   
drive: 
   Specifies a floppy disk drive or logical drive that was previously 
   specified in a JOIN command that you are now canceling. 
   
SWITCH
------
/D
    Cancels any previous JOIN commands for the drive you specify.

Drive1 becomes invalid 
----------------------
After you use the JOIN command, the drive1 you specify becomes invalid. 
If you then try to use it, MS-DOS displays the following message: 

   Invalid drive specification 
   
Limitations on path 
-------------------
If the directory specified by path already exists before you use the 
JOIN command, you cannot use that directory for any other purpose while 
JOIN is in effect. If the directory is not empty, MS-DOS does not complete 
the join operation and displays the following message: 

   Directory not empty 

If the directory does not exist, MS-DOS tries to create it. 

Limitations on using JOIN with other commands 
---------------------------------------------
The following commands do not work with drives formed by the JOIN command: 
ASSIGN      BACKUP     CHKDSK     DISKCOMP
DISKCOPY    FDISK      FORMAT     LABEL
MIRROR      MIRROR     RESTORE    SYS

Using JOIN with no parameters 
-----------------------------
You can use the JOIN command with no parameters to see a list of the 
currently joined drives. 

EXAMPLES
--------
You can join any directory or subdirectory in a tree structure. For 
example, the following commands are valid: 

   join d: c:sales 
   
   join d: c:salesoctober 
   
To reverse either of the previous JOIN commands, type the drive1 value followed by the /D switch, as follows: 
join d: /d 

KBDBUF.SYS-------------------------------------------------------------------

Specifies the number of keystrokes that can be held in your keyboard buffer.

SYNTAX
------
DEVICE=KBDBUF.SYS nnnn

PARAMETER
---------
nnnn
   Specifies the number of keystrokes that can be held in the keyboard 
   buffer. The acceptable range is 16 to 1024

NOTES
-----
The KBDBUF.SYS driver should be loaded with the DEVICE command early
in your CONFIG.SYS file. In addition, you cannot load the KBDBUF.SYS
driver into the upper memory area. If you run MemMaker, choose Custom, 
and exclude the driver from the optimization process.

EXAMPLE
-------
If you want to specify a keyboard buffer that allows you to type ahead
25 keystrokes beyond what has been displayed on your screen, add
the following command to your CONFIG.SYS file:

DEVICE=KBDBUF.SYS 25

LCD.CPI----------------------------------------------------------------------

Code-page information file for IBM PC Convertible liquid crystal display.

MIRROR-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Starts the MIRROR program, which records information about one or more 
disks; the UNFORMAT and UNDELETE commands can use this information to 
restore a reformatted disk or to recover deleted files. 

SYNTAX
------
MIRROR [drive:[ ...]] [/1] [/Tdrive[-entries][ ...]] 

MIRROR [/u] 

MIRROR [/partn] 

To save information about the disk in the current drive, use the following 
syntax:  

MIRROR 

PARAMETER
---------
drive:
   Specifies the drive containing the disk for which you want MIRROR to
   save information. This information is used by the UNFORMAT command to
   restore a disk.

SWITCHES
--------
/1
   Retains only the latest information about the disk. If you do not
   specify this switch, MIRROR makes a backup copy of the existing
   disk-information file before recording the current information.

/Tdrive[-entries]
   Loads a terminate-and-stay-resident deletion-tracking program that
   records information used by the UNDELETE command to recover deleted
   files. The required drive parameter specifies the drive containing
   the disk for which you want MIRROR to save information about deleted
   files. The optional entries parameter, which must be a value in the
   range 1 through 999, specifies the maximum number of entries in the
   deletion-tracking file (PCTRACKR.DEL). The default value for entries
   is dependent upon the type of disk being tracked. The following list
   shows each disk size, its default number of entries, and its
   corresponding file size:

Disk size          Entries       File size 
360K                  25            5K 
720K                  50            9K 
1.2 megabyte (MB)     75           14K
1.44 MB               75           14K 
20 MB                101           18K 
32 MB                202           36K
32 MB                303           55K

CAUTION  Do not use deletion tracking for any drive that has been 
redirected by using the JOIN or SUBST command. If you intend to use the 
ASSIGN command, you must do so before using MIRROR to install deletion 
tracking. 

/U
   Unloads the deletion-tracking program from memory, disabling deletion
   tracking. You cannot unload the tracking program if you loaded any
   other memory-resident programs after it.

/PARTN
   Saves system information about how a hard disk is partitioned. The
   switch saves the information in a file on a floppy disk. The UNFORMAT
   command can use this file later to rebuild the partitions of a disk.

Saving information about a disk 
-------------------------------
The MIRROR program saves a copy of the file allocation table and the root 
directory of the disk in the specified drive. The UNFORMAT command can 
use this information to rebuild a disk that has been unintentionally 
formatted, or it can use the information to recover files and subdirectories 
in the disk's root directory. 

Because UNFORMAT restores the disk’s system area to the condition it was 
in when you last used MIRROR, you should save this information frequently 
for every hard disk drive in your system. To ensure that the information 
is saved each time you turn on your computer, you may want to add a MIRROR 
command to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. 

Removing the deletion-tracking program from memory 
--------------------------------------------------
You may need to remove the deletion-tracking program from memory. To do so, 
remove all memory-resident programs that you loaded after the deletion-
tracking program, and then use the MIRROR command with the /U switch. 
Since this turns off deletion tracking, any files deleted after you remove 
the tracking program can be recovered only by using information in the 
directory. 

Saving information about hard-disk partitions 
---------------------------------------------
Every formatted hard disk drive has at least one partition. To identify a 
hard disk drive, MS-DOS uses information stored in a special disk partition 
table. If this table is corrupted, MS-DOS cannot locate the hard disk. 

You can save partition-table information for a hard disk by using the 
MIRROR command with the /PARTN switch. This switch creates a file named 
PARTNSAV.FIL, which the UNFORMAT command can use to rebuild the partition 
table. Because MS-DOS cannot gain access to your hard disk if the partition 
table is damaged, you should not put this file on the hard disk itself. 
Instead, you should put the file on a floppy disk (which you should keep 
in a safe place) or on another hard disk drive, such as a network server. 

EXAMPLES
--------
To save a copy of the file allocation table and the root directory of 
drive C and to install deletion tracking for drives A and C, type the 
following command: 

   mirror c: /ta /tc 
   
Suppose you want to save a copy of the file allocation table and the root 
directory of the disk in the current drive, and you want to install the 
deletion-tracking program for drive C. To do this and to set the maximum 
number of deletions to be tracked to 500, type the following command. 
(Note that since no drive parameter is specified, MIRROR saves the 
information about the disk in the current drive.) 

   mirror /tc-500 

To save a copy of the partition table for your hard disk drive, type the 
following command: 

   mirror /partn 
   
The MIRROR program displays the following information: 

   Disk Partition Table saver. 
   The partition information from your hard drive(s) has been read. 
   Next, the file PARTNSAV.FIL will be written to a floppy disk. Please 
   insert a formatted diskette and enter the name of the diskette drive. 
   What drive? A 

The default disk drive is drive A. If you want to use a different drive, 
type the drive letter (making sure it does not identify a partition on 
the hard disk drive), insert a formatted floppy disk in the drive (if 
necessary), and press ENTER. 

MSHERC----------------------------------------------------------------------

Installs support for Qbasic programs that use the Hercules graphics
card.

SYNTAX
------
MSHERC [/HALF]

SWITCH
------
/HALF
   Use this switch when a color adapter is also installed.

PRINTER.SYS------------------------------------------------------------------

Supports code-page switching for the parallel ports PRN, LPT1, LPT2, and 
LPT3. 

SYNTAX
------ 
DEVICE=[drive:][path]PRINTER.SYS LPTx=(type[,[hwcp][,n]]) 

PARAMETERS
----------
[drive:][path]
   Specifies the location of the PRINTER.SYS file.

LPTx
    Specifies the number of the parallel port for which you want to support
    code-page switching.

type
    Specifies the printer in use. The following list shows valid values for
    type and the printers represented by each value:

    4201    IBM Proprinters II and III Model 4201
	    IBM Proprinters II and III XL Model 4202
    4208    IBM Proprinter X24E Model 4207
	    IBM Proprinter XL24E Model 4208
    5202    IBM Quietwriter III Model 5202

hwcp
    Specifies the code page your hardware supports. The following list
    shows the code pages that MS-DOS supports and the country or language
    for each:

    437    United States
    850    Multilingual (Latin I)
    852    Slavic (Latin II)
    860    Portuguese
    863    Canadian-French
    865    Nordic

n
    Specifies the number of code pages your hardware can support in
    addition to the code page specified in the hwcp parameter.

EXAMPLE
-------
The following command loads the PRINTER.SYS device driver for use with the 
IBM Proprinter X24E Model 4207, loads code page 850, and prepares 
PRINTER.SYS to support two additional code pages: 

   device=c:\dos\printer.sys lpt1:=(4208,850,2) 
   
PRINTFIX--------------------------------------------------------------------

Prevents MS-DOS from checking the status of your printer. Use this
command only if you have had problems printing since you installed
MS-DOS 6.22.

SYNTAX
------
PRINTFIX

SETUP------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installs the commands and files on the Supplemental disks to your
hard drive.

SYNTAX
------
SETUP [drive:][path]

PARAMETERS
----------
[drive:][path]
   The drive and directory to which you want to install the Supplemental
   disk commands and files

NOTES
-----
You can run the Setup program from a floppy drive, your hard disk, or
from a network drive--just make sure the Setup program is in the same
drive and directory that contains your Supplemental disk files.

If you install any of the Utilities from MS-DOS 5.0, such as the Backup 
program, you must restart your computer before using them. This is because 
the Setup program modifies your SETVER table, and you must restart your
computer for the modifications to take effect.

SPATCH.BAT------------------------------------------------------------------

If your computer uses a Windows 3.0 permanent swap file, run 
the SPATCH.BAT program to make the swap file compatible with MS-DOS 6.22. 

For more information, see the README.TXT file included with MS-DOS 6.22.

NOTE: This file is included on the Supplemental disks because some
versions of MS-DOS did not include the file.
