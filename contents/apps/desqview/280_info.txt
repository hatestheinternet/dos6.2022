Notes:

Install QEMM!  DV relies on it.  If you can't get ST:M, then try another
computer.  See QEMM803.  When you set up CONFIG.SYS, be sure to NOT set
DOS=HIGH.  DV uses 100% of the HMA but DOS uses only about 40K of it, so
you waste 24K of precious RAM if you set DOS=HIGH.

Use DOS 6.x, not 7.x.

Hint:  The ALT key is not held down; just tap it.
