Quarterdeck QEMM 8.01
Released in 1996 by Quarterdeck
For DOS/Win 3.x/95

Serial: 000-08A-00009

Notes:
Use MS-DOS 6.x.  DOS 7.x contains elements that DOS-UP and DOSDATA can't load
high.  If you have hardware that uses ROM memory, try to configure it such
that the ROM is immediately after your video ROM (usually at C800).  If you
have multiple devices with ROMs and you can configure them so they are
adjacent, you will get larger blocks of high memory into which your TSRs can
load.  See the TECHNOTE directory if you have questions.

Install QEMM801 but do not let INSTALL start OPTIMIZE.

Rename your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, then put the files from disk
1 in the root directory.  Boot and reboot using these files.  If something
horrible happens, you can prevent QEMM386.SYS from loading by holding the
ALT key during the boot, then hitting ESCAPE when prompted.  In that event,
try using the TROUBLESHOOTING "DEVICE" line in CONFIG.SYS.  If the trouble-
shooting switches work, remove one at a time and boot and reboot, putting
back the one(s) that is (are) needed.  The most commonly needed switches are
SH:N and RH:N.  If you need SH:N, QEMM will warn you when you boot.  Too bad
OPTIMIZE can't add SH:N if it is needed, but Steve Goodrich refused, so...

When you can boot and reboot, delete \QEMM\OPTIMIZE.INI and then run
OPTIMIZE /ST /Q

/ST means to run the STEALTH testing first, which is far more likely to
succeed than if you let the testing occur later in the OPTIMIZE process.

If you can't get a working ST:M then you're wasting your time to attempt to
run DVX.  You can run DV with ST:F but your windows will have constricted
conventional memory available.  Try another video card,  Or try another
computer.  Video cards are the most common reason for ST:M to fail.

After getting an ST:M or ST:F parameter on the QEMM line with OPTIMIZE, put
QEMM803D.EXE into your QEMM directory and run it.  When it finishes
extracting, run the RUNME.BAT file.  Ignore any "error" messages.

Run MFT and hit all the options.  If MFT causes any problems (except in
detecting your CPU; that's OK), then RTFM; find and fix the problem.

Restore your original CONFIG.SYS and put the QEMM386.SYS device line you
generated from running OPTIMIZE /ST /Q at the top of it.  Be sure to REM
any HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE lines that might exist in your CONFIG.  Leave
AUTOEXEC.BAT as it is and run
OPTIMIZE /NH /Q

/NH means "skip the hardware testing".

Assuming that all goes well, restore your original AUTOEXEC.BAT and add QEMM
to your PATH.  Again run OPTIMIZE /NH /Q 

Run QSETUP and enable DOS-UP.  Do not let OPTIMIZE run.  Edit CONFIG.SYS and
remove DOS=HIGH.  DOS=UMB will allow Microsoft MEM to see your high RAM, but
you should use Manifest (MFT) rather than MEM anyway, so UMB is superflous.

QDPMI is for C programming; you probably don't want or need it.

One more time: OPTIMIZE /NH /Q

Now install DV or DVX.  DVX will ask to install QEMM; Just Say No.
