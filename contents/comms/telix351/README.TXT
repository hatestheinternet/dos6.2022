You may reconfigure your copy of Telix for a new modem
at any time by running the program MODEMCFG.EXE from
the DOS prompt in the Telix directory. We are about to
run this program to automatically configure your modem.

Once MODEMCFG has completed, you will be ready to run
Telix! At the DOS prompt from within Telix's directory,
type "TELIX" to run the program. Enjoy using this fully
registered copy of Telix!
