You are currently  using the Telix  installation program.
This installation program  will extract and  install your
Telix  version  into  your  desired directory,  and allow
you to  setup your modem  from an offered  modem list for
proper use with  Telix. You can  also restart this  modem
configuration  program  later  during  a Telix session at
any time by pressing Alt-F1.

PLEASE  NOTE! When you enter a  directory name during the
installation, where an  older Telix version  already does
exist,  all  Telix  related   files  (in  the  scope   of
delivery)  are  being  overwritten.  However,  all  Telix
configuration  files  *.CNF  as  well  as Telix phonebook
files *.FON won't  be overwritten. In  any case a  backup
copy of all existing files is strongly recommended.
