     Telix is Copyright (c) 1986-1996 by deltaComm Development, Inc.

     Telix is not, nor has ever been, public domain or free software.

     The commercial, registered version of Telix may not be duplicated other
     than for backup purposes. A registered copy of Telix must be treated like a
     book, in that the same registered copy of Telix may not be used in more
     than one computer at the same time, just as a book may not be read by more
     than one person at the same time (without making an illegal copy).

     Users are granted a limited license to use the User Supported, trial
     version of Telix for a limited evaluation period of up to 45 days, in order
     to determine if it suits their needs. Any other use of Telix or use past
     this period requires registration.

     All users are granted a limited license to copy the User Supported version
     of Telix only for the purpose of allowing others to try it, subject to the
     above restrictions as well as these:

          Telix must be distributed in absolutely unmodified form, including ALL
          program, documentation, and other files.

          Telix may not be included with any other product for any reason
          whatsoever without a license from deltaComm Development, Inc.

          No charge or payment may be levied or accepted for Telix.

     Bulletin Board system operators may post the unregistered, User Supported
     version of Telix on their BBS for downloading by their users without
     written permission only if the above conditions are met, and only if no
     special fee is necessary to access the Telix files (a general fee to access
     the BBS is ok).

     Distributors of User Supported and Public Domain software MUST obtain
     written permission from deltaComm Development, Inc., before distributing
     Telix and must follow the above conditions, as well as other detailed at
     the time of request for a distributor's license.

     Liquidated damages assessed and collectible from distributors of User
     Supported and Public Domain software found to be distributing Telix
     without a current distributor's license in writing from deltaComm shall
     be $2 US (Two United States Dollars) *per unauthorized distributed copy*.

                       Telix Ordering/Registration Information

     Registering (buying) Telix allows you to use the product after the trial
     period. Registered Telix users get the current version of Telix on disk
     along with their own serial number, an optional printed manual, mailed
     notification of major Telix updates, and priority when calling the Telix
     Software support BBS (we guarantee no support to unregistered users). Most
     importantly, registered users know they are helping to make sure that high-
     quality software like Telix continues to be sold in this low-cost way.

     Telix registration costs $69 US / $94 CDN, and includes a 'registered' copy
     of Telix on disk.

     An evaluation disk with the current copy of Telix on it is also available
     for $10 US / $12 CDN. This is to be used to try out Telix, and does not
     include registration (the right to use Telix after the evaluation period).
     The fee covers the cost of diskette(s) and handling.

     Registered users will receive access to our online service, featuring many
     thousands of megabytes of shareware for download, access to internation
     echo mail, Internet mail, Reuters news services, weather services, stock

     access to all of the above features and more, is included with your order.

     and over. All US dollar checks must be drawn on a US bank, and all Canadian
     dollar checks must be drawn on a Canadian bank. Note that we quote
     equivalent prices in both $US and $CDN, but as we are a US company all
     credit card orders will be billed in $US, and your card statement will show
     any conversion between currencies.

     Multiple copy purchases are simply bulk purchases and include that many
     copies of Telix on disk (with optional printed manuals), as with single
     registrations. We also have available site licenses (at a slight reduction
     in price), which are based on a fixed number of copies, but in which the
     site performs the diskette duplication from master disks and labels
     supplied by us.
