Hello!
I'm glad to represent new small utility for BBS-sites worked
via internet. This programm - 4-channel emulator of modem &
fossil driver. It allow to have 4 virtual modems on your BBS
as addition to real modems, or you can use only virtual lines.
This programm NOT A TSR, what more easy to unload. Driver support
as incoming as outgoing calls, and emulate some HAYES command.
Driver use internet service 513 (remote login) and compatible
handshake. Your bbs with this driver will allow from UNIX (over 
"rlogin name") or from any communication tool with fossil support,
worked with this emulator (ex. FD terminal, Terminate, Telemate etc.),
or from rlogin in any TCP packet (for ex. PC/TCP, CUTCP Telbin, etc.).

Required:
	IBM-PC XT/AT 8086 and above
	MS-DOS 3.3 and above
	Packet driver class 1 (Ethernet).

Supported:
	TopView.
	DesqView.
	Windows 3.1, and 3.11 (for Workgroups).

Usage:
  RLFOSSIL.EXE start_portn ports progname [idname]

where: start_portn - number of first serial port what will emulated
                     (0 -COM1:, 1-COM2: etc).
       ports       - number of ports what will emulated ( 1 - 4 ).
       progname    - programm name what will launched after start of
		     driver, when this programm will terminated, driver
		     will unload. This parameter can include arguments for
		     launched programm. In such case it must be placed in "".
       idname      - your default login name for outgoing calls 
                     (if parameter missed idname= "root").

exmples of usage:
Usage Telemate with 1 virtual modem on COM1:
  RLFOSSIL.EXE 0 1 TM.EXE

Usage Telemate script file with 1 virtual modem on COM3: , and default login
name "guest"
  RLFOSSIL.EXE 2 1 "TM.EXE SCRIPT.TMS" guest

Usage ORACOMM multiline BBS with 4 virtual modems on COM1: - COM4:
  RLFOSSIL.EXE 0 4 ORACOMM.EXE

Usage multiline BBS under WINDOWS with 4 virtual modems on COM5: - COM8:
  RLFOSSIL.EXE 4 4 WIN.COM
<Files BBS.BAT must be placed in STARTUP window>

Usage multiline BBS under DV with 4 virtual modems on COM5: - COM8:
  RLFOSSIL.EXE 4 4 DV.COM
<Files BBS.BAT must be launched from STARTUP script>

Driver X00 or BNU for real modems must be started early and ports of
virtual modems must be choosed different with real modems.

commands of virtual modem:
ATDP 192.168.5.5
  outgoing connection to 192.168.5.5
ATDP machine.my.net
  outgoing connection to machine.my.net (nameserver must be defined in
  wattcp.cfg).
ATDP guest@192.168.4.9
  outgoing connection to 192.168.4.9 as user "guest"
ATA 
  answer on incoming calls (only after "RING")
  all other commands beginning with AT - answer OK but do nothing.

virtual modem messages:
NO DIALTONE - cannot resolve hostname (may be wrong nameserver?)
NO CARRIER  - host or service not available, or no route to host,
              (after ATDP), or connection closed by programm or 
              another host (after connection).
CONNECT 9600/TCP/IP - connection established (after ATDP or ATA).
RING        - incoming connection established, but you must enter
              ATA to confirm it.
OK          - Standard modem answer on most commands.

maximal transfer speed:
18636 - CPS (~150 KBPS).
Internal buffers, fossil level:
1024Bytes -TX, 1024Bytes -RX
Internal buffers, TCP level:
2048Bytes -TX, 2048Bytes -RX
Connection timeout 30 seconds.
config file:
wattcp.cfg - see inside

All remarks send to root@hq.icb.chel.su, Andrew Sapozhikov (Sapa).
P.S.	Sorry for my bad english, remarks about my english allowed too.
